<ol>
  <li>In excercise 1 my big question is why didnt <i>console.log('last animal is', animalArray[animalArray.lenth - 1]);</i> 
    work while trying to list the last value. Is it because the second half isnt a variable? Thanks. I ended up defining a new variable as = to animalArray.lenth - 1 and that worked</li>
  <li>In excercise 2 I wanted to define even in question 1c. I got the result 
    I wanted by starting at 2 and adding 2 from there which will only yield even numbers. I found other ways online.
    Could I have written: <i>num % 2 == 0</i> which is an example I found online. Would this be a fair use?</li>
  <li>In excercise 3, along with my question in excercise 2, I wanted to know if I properly used an example format from online that constituted fair use. 
    Specifically my answer to question 8. I found an example format (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39934344/with-javascript-use-a-for-loop-to-sum-numbers-in-an-array) that defined the sum as a seperate variable and 
    then used that in the loop as needed. I modified it to fit my needs.
    Is this another example of why
    my question in excercise 1 about an input not being viable because i am trying to add together a non variable and the array?
