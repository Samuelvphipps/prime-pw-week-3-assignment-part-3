<ol>
  <li>In excercise 1 my big question is why didnt <i>console.log('last animal is', animalArray[animalArray.lenth - 1]);</i> 
    work while trying to list the last value. Is it because the second half isnt a variable? Thanks. I ended up defining a new variable as = to animalArray.lenth - 1 and that worked</li>
  <li>In excercise 2 I wanted to define even in question 1c but wasnt sure how to use it without googling. I got the result I wanted on my own but found other ways online.
    Could I have written: <i>num % 2 == 0</i> which is an example I found online. Would this be a fair use?</li>
  <li>In excercise 3, along with my question in excercise 2, I wanted to know if I properly used an example format from online that constituted fair use. 
    Specifically my answer to question 8. I found an example that defined the sum as a seperate variable and then used that in the loop as needed. Is this another example of why
    my question in excercise 1 not being viable because i am trying to add together a non variable and the array?
